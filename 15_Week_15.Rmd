## Lab review {-}

Throughout the lab sections this semester, we have been focusing largely on solving differential equations using the package `deSolve` and visualize the system dynamics with ggplots. We have also used for loops to model discrete-time population growth. Lastly, we have learned how to analyze age-structured models using matrix computation as well as eigenanalysis to estimate the asymptotic growth rate and stable age distribution.    

Here is a brief summary of the key points regarding these modeling techniques:

### 1. deSolve and numerical integration {-}






### 2. for loops {-}






### 3. Matrix computation and eigenanalysis {-}
