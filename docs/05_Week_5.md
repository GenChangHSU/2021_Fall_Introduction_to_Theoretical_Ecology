## Lab demonstration {-}


**Part 1 - Analyzing Leslie matrix using for loops**


```r
library(tidyverse)

# Create a Leslie matrix

# Set an initial size for each age class

# for loop and matrix algebra

# Visualize the results (animation of age distribution dynamics + total pop size)

# Summary of age structure and pop growth
```


**Part 2 - Analyzing Leslie matrix using eigenanalysis**


```r
library(tidyverse)

# Eigenanalysis on the Leslie matrix

# Compare with the for loop results
```


**Part 3 - Advanced topic: Incorporating density-dependence into Leslie matrix **


```r
library(tidyverse)

# Incorporate density-dependence transitions

# For loop and matrix algebra

# Visualize the results (animation of age distribution dynamics + total pop size)
```
