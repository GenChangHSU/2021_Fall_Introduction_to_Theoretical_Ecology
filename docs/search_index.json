SIR model without demography System of equations: \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dS}{dt} =-\\beta SI\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dI}{dt} = \\beta SI-\\rho I\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dR}{dt} = \\rho I\\end{align}\\) \\(R_{0}\\): the number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population (= per capita infection in a fully susceptible population*infectious time) For SIR model without demography, \\(R_{0}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\beta}{\\rho}S_{0}\\) Can the disease spread at \\(S_{0}\\)? The invasion growth rate of I is \\(\\lim_{I \\to 0} \\frac{dI}{dt}\\frac{1}{I} = \\beta S_{0}-\\rho\\) If \\(R_{0}\\) &gt; 1, IGR &gt; 0, the disease can spread initially but will later decline and eventually self-extinguish. Part of the population will be free from the infection. S and R coexist at the equilibrium. If \\(R_{0}\\) &lt; 1, IGR &lt; 0, disease cannot spread and will just gradually die out. The population will consist of mostly S and a few R at the equilibrium. SIR model with demography System of equations: \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dS}{dt} = \\theta-\\beta SI-\\delta S\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dI}{dt} = \\beta SI-\\rho I-\\gamma I\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dR}{dt} = \\rho I-\\delta R\\end{align}\\) \\(R_{0}\\) is \\(\\frac {\\beta}{\\rho+\\gamma}\\frac{\\theta}{\\delta}\\) The equilibrium points: \\(E_{DF}\\) (disease-free equilibrium) \\(E_{E}\\) Invasion analysis Local stability analysis \\(E_{DF}\\) \\(J_{DF}\\) Stable if $= $, or \\(R_{0} &lt; 1\\) \\(E_{E}\\) \\(J_{E}\\) Stable if $= $, or \\(R_{0} &lt; 1\\) Lab demonstration In todays lab, we are going to simulate the SIR model with demography and visualize two types of disease dynamics: (1) the endemic equilibrium, at which the S, I, and R all coexist, and (2) the disease-free equilibrium, at which the disease will die off and only S remains. \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dS}{dt} = \\theta-\\beta SI-\\delta S\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dI}{dt} = \\beta SI-\\rho I-\\gamma I\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dR}{dt} = \\rho I-\\delta R\\end{align}\\) library(tidyverse) library(deSolve) SIR_model_fun &lt;- function(theta, beta, delta, rho, gamma, title){ # model specification SIR_model &lt;- function(times, state, parms) { with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { dS_dt = theta - beta*S*I - delta*S dI_dt = beta*S*I - rho*I - gamma*I dR_dt = rho*I - delta*R return(list(c(dS_dt, dI_dt, dR_dt))) }) } # model parameters times &lt;- seq(0, 1000, by = 1) state &lt;- c(S = 25, I = 0.1, R = 0) parms &lt;- c(theta = theta, beta = beta, delta = delta, rho = rho, gamma = gamma) # model application SIR_out &lt;- ode(func = SIR_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) # visualization SIR_out %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = &quot;state&quot;, values_to = &quot;N&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(state = fct_relevel(state, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;R&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = N, color = state)) + geom_line(size = 1.5) + theme_classic(base_size = 14) + labs(x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = &quot;N&quot;, title = title) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1010), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 55), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_color_brewer(name = NULL, palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) } ### Epidemic equilibrium SIR_model_fun(theta = 0.25, beta = 0.01, delta = 0.01, rho = 0.02, gamma = 0.02, title = &quot;Epidemic equilibrium&quot;) ### Disease-free equilibrium SIR_model_fun(theta = 0.25, beta = 0.01, delta = 0.01, rho = 0.3, gamma = 0.02, title = &quot;Disease-free equilibrium&quot;) By increasing the recovery rate \\(\\rho\\) in the second example, we drive the basic reproduction number \\(R_{0}\\) below 1, and thus the disease will not spread and the system reaches the disease-free equilibrium.
