[["index.html", "Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Course Information", " Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Instructor: Po-Ju Ke \\(~~~~~\\) Teaching Assistant: Gen-Chang Hsu 2021 Fall at National Taiwan Univeristy Course Information Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in ecology, starting from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multi-species models. The course will primarily focus on population and community ecology, but we will also briefly discuss models in epidemiology and ecosystem ecology. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture followed by a one-hour hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and derive general theories in ecology. In the hands-on practice section, we will use a combination of analytical problem sets, interactive applications, and numerical simulations to gain a general understanding of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objectives By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirements Students are expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. Format Tuesday 1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm at Room 207, Gongtong Lecture Building Lecture (two hours): selected topics of ecological theories and models (blackboard writing) Lab (one hour): hands-on practice in programming and simulation (using R) + discussion Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will be using a combination of textbooks and literature articles on theoretical ecology in this course.
