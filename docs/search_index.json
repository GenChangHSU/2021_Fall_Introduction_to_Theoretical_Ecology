The first three weeks of this course will be online. We will host the two modules of this course (i.e., 2-hr lecture and 1-hr practice) on different platforms. We will use Google Meet for the lecture section (link here). To mimic an environment where we can provide one-on-one coding advice, we will use Gather Town for the hands-on practice section (link here). Please login in advance to make sure it is working; learn how to use Gather Town here. For those who wish to enroll manually, please join the first lecture and stay online afterward. Since we have moved to a larger classroom due to COVID-19 regulation, we can accommodate more students. We have asked students to introduce themselves (e.g., research interest and familiarity with R; 1-2 minutes) during the first time we meet online, so please also be prepared if you wish to enroll. Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in ecology, starting from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multi-species models. The course will primarily focus on population and community ecology, but we will also briefly discuss models in epidemiology and ecosystem ecology. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture followed by a one-hour hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and derive general theories in ecology. In the hands-on practice section, we will use a combination of analytical problem sets, interactive applications, and numerical simulations to gain a general understanding of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objectives By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirements Students are expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. Format Tuesday 1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm at Classroom 3C, Life Science Building Lecture (two hours): selected topics of ecological theories and models (blackboard writing) Lab (one hour): hands-on practice in programming and simulation (using R) + discussion Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will be using a combination of textbooks and literature articles on theoretical ecology in this course.

It has a complex life cycle consisting of various stages. The seeds may lie dormant for one or two years. Seeds that germinate form small rosettes, which will gradually transit into medium and eventually large rosettes. These rosettes (all three sizes) may remain in the same stage for years before entering the next stage. After undergoing vernalization, large (and a few medium) rosettes will form stalks and flower in the upcoming summer, set seeds once, and die. Occasionally, the flowering plants will produce seeds that directly germinate into small/medium/large rosettes without entering dormancy. Here is a transition diagram for the teasel. Please convert this diagram into a stage-based transition matrix (Lefkovitch matrix) and derive the asymptotic growth rate \\(\\lambda\\) in R. Part 4 - Advanced topic: Incorporating density-dependence into Leslie matrix The cell values in a standard Leslie matrix are fixed and independent of population density, leading to an exponential population growth. This assumption can be relaxed by incorporating density-dependence into the transitions (survival probability, fecundity). Here, we will include negative density-dependence for the fecundity of individuals in Age3 class and see how this might affect the long-term population dynamics. ### Leslie matrix, initial age classes, and carrying capacity leslie_mtrx &lt;- matrix(data = c(0, 1, 5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T) initial_age &lt;- c(10, 0, 0) K &lt;- 300 ### for loop and matrix algebra time &lt;- 150 pop_size_dens_dep &lt;- data.frame(Age1 = numeric(time+1), Age2 = numeric(time+1), Age3 = numeric(time+1)) pop_size_dens_dep[1, ] &lt;- initial_age for (i in 1:time) { N &lt;- sum(pop_size_dens_dep[i, ]) # the current population size leslie_mtrx_dens_dep &lt;- leslie_mtrx # negative density-dependence for the fecundity of individuals in Age3 class ifelse((1-N/K) &gt; 0, leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3] &lt;- leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3]*(1-N/K), leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3] &lt;- 0) pop_size_dens_dep[i+1, ] &lt;- leslie_mtrx_dens_dep %*% as.matrix(t(pop_size_dens_dep[i, ])) } pop_size_dens_dep &lt;- pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% round() %&gt;% mutate(Total_N = rowSums(.), Time = 0:time) %&gt;% relocate(Time) head(round(pop_size_dens_dep)) ## Time Age1 Age2 Age3 Total_N ## 1 0 10 0 0 10 ## 2 1 0 5 0 5 ## 3 2 5 0 2 7 ## 4 3 7 2 0 9 ## 5 4 2 4 1 7 ## 6 5 7 1 1 9 ### Age distribution age_distribution_dens_dep &lt;- round(pop_size_dens_dep[time+1, 2:4]/sum(pop_size_dens_dep[time+1, 2:4]), 3) age_distribution_dens_dep ## Age1 Age2 Age3 ## 151 0.61 0.3 0.09 ### Total population size pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -Time, names_to = &quot;Age_class&quot;, values_to = &quot;N&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = N, color = Age_class)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;time&quot;, y = expression(italic(N))) + theme_classic(base_size = 12) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, time*1.05), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(pop_size_dens_dep$Total_N)*1.05), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), name = NULL, label = c(&quot;Age1&quot;, &quot;Age2&quot;, &quot;Age3&quot;, &quot;Total&quot;)) ### Stable age distribution age_animate_dens_dep &lt;- pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% mutate(across(Age1:Age3, function(x){x/Total_N})) %&gt;% select(Time, Age1:Age3) %&gt;% pivot_longer(Age1:Age3, names_to = &quot;Age&quot;, values_to = &quot;Proportion&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Proportion, fill = Age)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, show.legend = F) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 12) + transition_manual(Time) + ggtitle(&quot;Time {frame}&quot;) + theme(title = element_text(size = 15)) anim_save(&quot;age_distribution_dens_dep.gif&quot;, age_animate_dens_dep, nframes = time + 1, fps = 4, width = 5, height = 4, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) Part 5 - COM(P)ADRE: A global database of population matrices COM(P)ADRE is an online repository containing matrix population models on hundreds of plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, and viruses around the world, as well as their associated metadata.

The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination. In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation \\(P_{ij}\\) to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species \\(i\\) but have soil microbes state \\(j\\). Here, as a single species model, \\(i\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant \\(A\\), respectively. Similarly, \\(j\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant \\(A\\), respectively. In summary: \\(P_{00}\\) represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites \\(P_{A0}\\) represents cites colonized by plant \\(A\\) but the soil is yet to be conditioned \\(P_{AA}\\) represents plant \\(A\\) colonizing a site with plant-\\(A\\)-specific microbial community \\(P_{0A}\\) represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant \\(A\\) At the landscape scale, \\(P_{ij}\\) represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, \\(\\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}\\), summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure. Here, \\(P_{00}\\) can be colonized by plant \\(A\\) when propagules arrive, transitioning the state from \\(P_{00}\\) to \\(P_{A0}\\). Plants may die, with rate \\(m_{A}\\), before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) back to \\(P_{00}\\)), or may successfully condition the soil with rate \\(c_{A}\\) (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) to \\(P_{AA}\\)). After plants within the state \\(P_{AA}\\) die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as \\(P_{0A}\\). These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from \\(P_{0A}\\) back to \\(P_{AA}\\)) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, \\(\\alpha\\). Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate \\(d_{A}\\), transitioning the state from \\(P_{0A}\\) to \\(P_{00}\\). In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system.

The fast variables will adjust rapidly to their new equilibria in response to a slight change in the slow variables, such that the slow variables can be viewed as constants from the perspective of fast variables. Here, we are going to use the Lotka-Volterra model with logistic prey growth to demonstrate time-scale separation: \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dN}{dt} = rN(1-\\frac{N}{K})-aNP\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dP}{dt} = eaNP-dP\\end{align}\\) We will treat prey as a fast variable and predator as a slow variable. First, we find the quasi-equilibrium \\(N^{\\wedge}\\) of prey by setting the prey equation to zero: \\(\\begin{align}N^{\\wedge} = K(1-\\frac{aP}{r}) \\end{align}\\) And then we plug \\(N^{\\wedge}\\) into predator equation: \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dP}{dt} = (eaK-d)P(1-\\frac{eaK(\\frac{a}{r})}{eaK-d}P)\\end{align}\\) What do you see in the above equation? It is actually a logistic growth model! So under time-scale separation, predator will exhibit logistic population growth. We will show this shortly in the code below. One simple way to achieve time-scale separation in this model is to increase the prey growth rate so that prey will grow much faster than predator, mimicking the shorter generation time of prey relative to that of predator. library(tidyverse) library(deSolve) Prey_logistic_model &lt;- function(times, state, parms) { with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { dN_dt = r*N*(1-(N/K))-a*N*P dP_dt = e*a*N*P-d*P return(list(c(dN_dt, dP_dt))) }) } times &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 0.01) state &lt;- c(N = 40, P = 20) parms &lt;- c(r = 40.0, K = 60, a = 0.1, e = 0.1, d = 0.5) # r is chosen to be sufficiently large for time-scale separation pop_size &lt;- ode(func = Prey_logistic_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) # population trajectories pop_size %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = &quot;species&quot;, values_to = &quot;N&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = N, color = species)) + geom_line(size = 1.5) + theme_classic(base_size = 12) + labs(x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = &quot;Population size&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100.5), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(pop_size[, -1])*1.2), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_color_brewer(name = NULL, palette = &quot;Set1&quot;, labels = c(&quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot;), direction = -1) # state-space diagram pop_size %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = N, y = P)) + geom_point(color = &quot;grey60&quot;, size = 3, shape = 21) + geom_vline(xintercept = with(as.list(parms), d/(e*a)), color = &quot;#E41A1C&quot;, size = 1) + geom_abline(slope = with(as.list(parms), -r/(a*K)), intercept = with(as.list(parms), r/a), color = &quot;#377EB8&quot;, size = 1) + geom_point(aes(x = with(as.list(parms), d/(e*a)), y = with(as.list(parms), -r/(a*K)*d/(e*a) + r/a)), size = 4) + theme_classic(base_size = 14) + theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color = &quot;#E41A1C&quot;, size = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(color = &quot;#377EB8&quot;, size = 1)) + labs(x = &quot;Prey&quot;, y = &quot;Predator&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(NA, 100)) If we solve for the new predator growth equation derived under time-scale separation using the same parameter set and visualize the population trajectory, we will get almost exactly the same predator growth pattern as that in the original model.

Part 3 - Relative nonlinearity We have seen in Part 1. that two species cannot coexist on one resource if the consumers consume it in a linear fashion. What if the consumers consume the resource in a non-linear fashion? Could that generate stable coexistence? In this part of the lab section, we will introduce non-linear (type II) functional response into the consumer-resource model in Part 1. for one of the consumers. We also change the resource equation to logistic growth and allow the two consumers to have different conversion efficiencies and mortality rates: \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dN_{1}}{dt} = e_{1}a_{1}RN_{1}-d_{1}N_{1}\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dN_{2}}{dt} = e_{2}\\frac{a_{2}R}{k_{2}+R}N_{2}-d_{2}N_{2}\\end{align}\\\\\\) \\(\\begin{align}\\frac {dR}{dt} = rR(1-\\frac{R}{K})-a_{1}RN_{1}-\\frac{a_{2}R}{k_{2}+R}N_{2}\\end{align}\\) library(tidyverse) library(deSolve) ### Model specification CR_model_nonlinear &lt;- function(times, state, parms){ with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { dN1_dt = e1*a1*R*N1 - d1*N1 dN2_dt = e2*(a2*R/(k2+R))*N2 - d2*N2 dR_dt = r*R*(1-(R/K)) - a1*R*N1 - ((a2*R)/(k2+R))*N2 return(list(c(dN1_dt, dN2_dt, dR_dt))) }) } ### Model parameters times &lt;- seq(0, 5000, by = 0.1) state &lt;- c(N1 = 0.3, N2 = 19, R = 106) parms &lt;- c(a1 = 0.003, a2 = 0.5, k2 = 50, e1 = 0.33, e2 = 0.3, d1 = 0.11, d2 = 0.1, r = 0.1, K = 300) ### Model application pop_size &lt;- ode(func = CR_model_nonlinear, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) pop_size %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -time, names_to = &quot;species&quot;, values_to = &quot;N&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(trophic = case_when(species %in% c(&quot;N1&quot;, &quot;N2&quot;) ~ &quot;Consumer&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;Resource&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = N, color = species)) + geom_line(size = 1.5) + facet_wrap(~ trophic, ncol = 2, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, strip.position = &quot;left&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 14) + theme(strip.background = element_blank(), strip.placement = &quot;outside&quot;, legend.position = &quot;top&quot;, legend.title = element_blank(), plot.margin = margin(r = 5)) + labs(x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = NULL) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5050), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_color_manual(name = NULL, values = c(&quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;)) As shown in the figure, the two consumers coexist in a fluctuating manner. In fact, the fluctuating properties generated by the combination of logistically growing resources and different nonlinear functions are critical for the coexistence of n species on k &lt; n resources in certain parameter spaces.

Below is a brief summary of the key points regarding these modeling techniques: 1. deSolve and numerical integration There are two main steps for solving odes with deSolve: Model specification: Create a function specifying your model structure, that is, a set of differential equations Model application: Set the time steps, initial conditions, and model parameters and run the ode() function to solve the system of differential equations p span#aaa:before { content: \"Step 1. \"; display: inline-block; margin-left: -3.5em; margin-right: 0.3em; } p span#bbb:before { content: \"Step 2. \"; display: inline-block; margin-left: -3.5em; margin-right: 0.3em; } d-article table.lightable-paper { margin-bottom: 0px; } Here is an ode example using the Lotka-Volterra competition model: library(deSolve) ### (1) Model specification LV_competition_model &lt;- function(times, state, parms) { with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { # system of differential equations dN1_dt = N1*(r1-a11*N1-a12*N2) dN2_dt = N2*(r2-a22*N2-a21*N1) # return the integration results (the objects need to be in the same order specified above) return(list(c(dN1_dt, dN2_dt))) }) } ### (2) Model application # parameter setup times &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 0.1) state &lt;- c(N1 = 10, N2 = 10) parms &lt;- c(r1 = 1.4, r2 = 1.2, a11 = 1/200, a21 = 1/400, a22 = 1/200, a12 = 1/300) # run the ode solver pop_size &lt;- ode(func = LV_competition_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) ### Take a look at the results head(pop_size) ## time N1 N2 ## [1,] 0.0 10.00000 10.00000 ## [2,] 0.1 11.40115 11.18554 ## [3,] 0.2 12.98354 12.49917 ## [4,] 0.3 14.76632 13.95156 ## [5,] 0.4 16.76949 15.55348 ## [6,] 0.5 19.01355 17.31557 2. for loops The key to using for loops is to identify what you would like to iterate over (e.g., time) and how many iterations there are (e.g., 100 iterations). Also, we will create an object beforehand to store the results of each for loop iteration. Here is a for loop example using the discrete logistic growth model: library(tidyverse) ### The discrete logistic growth equation and parameter setup log_fun &lt;- function(r, N, K){N + r*N*(1-N/K)} r &lt;- 1.8 K &lt;- 500 N0 &lt;- 10 time &lt;- 100 ### Create an empty object to store the for loop results pop_size &lt;- numeric(time) pop_size[1] &lt;- N0 ### Run the for loop for (i in 2:time) {pop_size[i] &lt;- log_fun(r = r, N = pop_size[i - 1], K = K)} ### Organize the for loop results pop_data &lt;- pop_size %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% rename(., pop_size = `.`) %&gt;% mutate(time = 0:(time-1)) %&gt;% relocate(time) head(pop_data) ## time pop_size ## 1 0 10.00000 ## 2 1 27.64000 ## 3 2 74.64171 ## 4 3 188.93980 ## 5 4 400.51775 ## 6 5 543.95762 3. Matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis In R, we use %*% (not *!) to do matrix multiplication. Make sure the two matrices are compatible: the number of columns in the first matrix should be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. If necessary, use t() to transpose the matrix so that the two matrices are compatible for multiplication. To perform eigenanalysis on a square matrix, simply pass the matrix into the function eigen() and store the results to an object. You can then access the eigenvalues and eigenvectors via object_name$values and object_name$vectors. Here is a Leslie matrix example: library(tidyverse) ### Leslie matrix and initial age classes leslie_mtrx &lt;- matrix(data = c(0, 1, 5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T) initial_age &lt;- c(10, 0, 0) ### for loop and matrix multiplication time &lt;- 50 pop_size &lt;- data.frame(Age1 = numeric(time+1), Age2 = numeric(time+1), Age3 = numeric(time+1)) pop_size[1, ] &lt;- initial_age for (i in 1:time) { # use &quot;%*%&quot; for matrix multiplication # &quot;leslie_mtrx&quot; (3-by-3) is compatible with &quot;as.matrix(t(pop_size[i, ]))&quot; (3-by-1) pop_size[i+1, ] &lt;- leslie_mtrx %*% as.matrix(t(pop_size[i, ])) } ### Organize the for loop results pop_size &lt;- pop_size %&gt;% round() %&gt;% mutate(Total_N = rowSums(.), Time = 0:time) %&gt;% relocate(Time) head(round(pop_size)) ## Time Age1 Age2 Age3 Total_N ## 1 0 10 0 0 10 ## 2 1 0 5 0 5 ## 3 2 5 0 2 7 ## 4 3 8 2 0 10 ## 5 4 2 4 1 7 ## 6 5 8 1 1 10 ### Eigenanalysis of the Leslie matrix eigen_out &lt;- eigen(leslie_mtrx) # dominant eigenvalue eigen_out$values[1] ## [1] 1.089991+0i # corresponding eigenvector eigen_out$vectors[, 1] ## [1] 0.9030054+0i 0.4142263+0i 0.1140082+0i Additional readings Assignments Modeling Idea for an Interesting Ecological Question "],["week-16.html", "Week 16", " Week 16 Final exam "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
