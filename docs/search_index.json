[["index.html", "Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Course Information", " Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Instructor: Po-Ju Ke \\(~~~~~\\) Teaching Assistant: Gen-Chang Hsu 2021 Fall at National Taiwan Univeristy Course Information IMPORTANT ANOUNCEMENT!!! The first three weeks of this course will be online. We will host the two modules of this course (i.e., 2-hr lecture and 1-hr practice) on different platforms. We will use Google Meet for the lecture section (link here). To mimic an environment where we can provide one-on-one coding advice, we will use Gather Town for the hands-on practice section (link here). Please login in advance to make sure it is working; learn how to use Gather Town here. For those who wish to enroll manually, please join the first lecture and stay online afterward. Since we have moved to a larger classroom due to COVID-19 regulation, we can accommodate more students. We have asked students to introduce themselves (e.g., research interest and familiarity with R; 1-2 minutes) during the first time we meet online, so please also be prepared if you wish to enroll. Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in ecology, starting from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multi-species models. The course will primarily focus on population and community ecology, but we will also briefly discuss models in epidemiology and ecosystem ecology. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture followed by a one-hour hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and derive general theories in ecology. In the hands-on practice section, we will use a combination of analytical problem sets, interactive applications, and numerical simulations to gain a general understanding of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objectives By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirements Students are expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. Format Tuesday 1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm at Classroom 3C, Life Science Building Lecture (two hours): selected topics of ecological theories and models (blackboard writing) Lab (one hour): hands-on practice in programming and simulation (using R) + discussion Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will be using a combination of textbooks and literature articles on theoretical ecology in this course.

It has a complex life cycle consisting of various stages. The seeds may lie dormant for one or two years. Seeds that germinate form small rosettes, which will gradually transit into medium and eventually large rosettes. These rosettes (all three sizes) may remain in the same stage for years before entering the next stage. After undergoing vernalization, large (and a few medium) rosettes will form stalks and flower in the upcoming summer, set seeds once, and die. Occasionally, the flowering plants will produce seeds that directly germinate into small/medium/large rosettes without entering dormancy. Here is a transition diagram for the teasel. Please convert this diagram into a stage-based transition matrix (Lefkovitch matrix) and derive the asymptotic growth rate \\(\\lambda\\) in R. Part 4 - Advanced topic: Incorporating density-dependence into Leslie matrix The cell values in a standard Leslie matrix are fixed and independent of population density, leading to an exponential population growth. This assumption can be relaxed by incorporating density-dependence into the transitions (survival probability, fecundity). Here, we will include negative density-dependence for the fecundity of individuals in Age3 class and see how this might affect the long-term population dynamics. ### Leslie matrix, initial age classes, and carrying capacity leslie_mtrx &lt;- matrix(data = c(0, 1, 5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T) initial_age &lt;- c(10, 0, 0) K &lt;- 300 ### for loop and matrix algebra time &lt;- 150 pop_size_dens_dep &lt;- data.frame(Age1 = numeric(time+1), Age2 = numeric(time+1), Age3 = numeric(time+1)) pop_size_dens_dep[1, ] &lt;- initial_age for (i in 1:time) { N &lt;- sum(pop_size_dens_dep[i, ]) # the current population size leslie_mtrx_dens_dep &lt;- leslie_mtrx # negative density-dependence for the fecundity of individuals in Age3 class ifelse((1-N/K) &gt; 0, leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3] &lt;- leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3]*(1-N/K), leslie_mtrx_dens_dep[1, 3] &lt;- 0) pop_size_dens_dep[i+1, ] &lt;- leslie_mtrx_dens_dep %*% as.matrix(t(pop_size_dens_dep[i, ])) } pop_size_dens_dep &lt;- pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% round() %&gt;% mutate(Total_N = rowSums(.), Time = 0:time) %&gt;% relocate(Time) head(round(pop_size_dens_dep)) ## Time Age1 Age2 Age3 Total_N ## 1 0 10 0 0 10 ## 2 1 0 5 0 5 ## 3 2 5 0 2 7 ## 4 3 7 2 0 9 ## 5 4 2 4 1 7 ## 6 5 7 1 1 9 ### Age distribution age_distribution_dens_dep &lt;- round(pop_size_dens_dep[time+1, 2:4]/sum(pop_size_dens_dep[time+1, 2:4]), 3) age_distribution_dens_dep ## Age1 Age2 Age3 ## 151 0.61 0.3 0.09 ### Total population size pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -Time, names_to = &quot;Age_class&quot;, values_to = &quot;N&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = N, color = Age_class)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;time&quot;, y = expression(italic(N))) + theme_classic(base_size = 12) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, time*1.05), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(pop_size_dens_dep$Total_N)*1.05), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), name = NULL, label = c(&quot;Age1&quot;, &quot;Age2&quot;, &quot;Age3&quot;, &quot;Total&quot;)) ### Stable age distribution age_animate_dens_dep &lt;- pop_size_dens_dep %&gt;% mutate(across(Age1:Age3, function(x){x/Total_N})) %&gt;% select(Time, Age1:Age3) %&gt;% pivot_longer(Age1:Age3, names_to = &quot;Age&quot;, values_to = &quot;Proportion&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Proportion, fill = Age)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, show.legend = F) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1), expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) + theme_classic(base_size = 12) + transition_manual(Time) + ggtitle(&quot;Time {frame}&quot;) + theme(title = element_text(size = 15)) anim_save(&quot;age_distribution_dens_dep.gif&quot;, age_animate_dens_dep, nframes = time + 1, fps = 4, width = 5, height = 4, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 300) Part 5 - COM(P)ADRE: A global database of population matrices COM(P)ADRE is an online repository containing matrix population models on hundreds of plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, and viruses around the world, as well as their associated metadata.

The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination. In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation \\(P_{ij}\\) to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species \\(i\\) but have soil microbes state \\(j\\). Here, as a single species model, \\(i\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant \\(A\\), respectively. Similarly, \\(j\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant \\(A\\), respectively. In summary: \\(P_{00}\\) represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites \\(P_{A0}\\) represents cites colonized by plant \\(A\\) but the soil is yet to be conditioned \\(P_{AA}\\) represents plant \\(A\\) colonizing a site with plant-\\(A\\)-specific microbial community \\(P_{0A}\\) represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant \\(A\\) At the landscape scale, \\(P_{ij}\\) represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, \\(\\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}\\), summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure. Here, \\(P_{00}\\) can be colonized by plant \\(A\\) when propagules arrive, transitioning the state from \\(P_{00}\\) to \\(P_{A0}\\). Plants may die, with rate \\(m_{A}\\), before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) back to \\(P_{00}\\)), or may successfully condition the soil with rate \\(c_{A}\\) (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) to \\(P_{AA}\\)). After plants within the state \\(P_{AA}\\) die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as \\(P_{0A}\\). These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from \\(P_{0A}\\) back to \\(P_{AA}\\)) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, \\(\\alpha\\). Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate \\(d_{A}\\), transitioning the state from \\(P_{0A}\\) to \\(P_{00}\\). In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system.
