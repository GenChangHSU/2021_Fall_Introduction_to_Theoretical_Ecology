## Lab review {-}

Throughout the lab sections this semester, we have been focusing largely on solving differential equations using the package `deSolve` and visualize the system dynamics with ggplots. We have also learned how to use for loops and matrix computations as well as eigenanalysis to estimate the asymptotic growth rate and stable age distribution of age-structured models.    

Here is a brief summary of the key points:

### 1. deSolve and numerical integration {-}





### 2. for loops and matrix computation {-} 






### 3. Eigenanalysis {-}
